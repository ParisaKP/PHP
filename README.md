# PHP
A database of movies and movie stars. This is the last project in "databasbaserad publicering", a course in Malmö University.
Every one may register by an email and search in the database, but only admin (there is an admin list) can add new records.
In order for this to work the files should be located on the web server, since PHP files first need to be processed in a web server before sending their output to the web browser.
